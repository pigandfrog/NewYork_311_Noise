# NewYork_311_Noise

This repository contains my first build project with Lambda School.  Have you ever wondered what is causing all the noise in New York City?  This notebook contains some visualizations of the noise complaints from the New York City.  The data comes from open data and is the 311 calls for the year 2017 that have to do with noise (Noise Complaints).
